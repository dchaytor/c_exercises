4-2:
integer division; value is truncated to 0 (1/3 = 0.33 -> 0)


4-3:
coder forgot to add variable to print to printf expression; compiler picks a random uninitialized value


4-4:
didn't use float flag in f-string expression; compiler thinks it's looking for an integer, and either typecasts value to int (truncating it) or throws an error or something
